                <h2>Junior - Cyber Security Major</h2>
                <p>Pleasure to meet you! I am D'Andre Lambert, a prior U.S. Navy Intelligence Specialists Reservists. I transferred from Wintrhop University this past Spring and
                    I'm persuing a degree in Cyber Security with a minor in Business. My current skills include HTML, Python, CSS, Java, JavaScript alongside building/repairing computers.
                    My goal in studying Cyber Security is to understand the fundamentals of how to protect, detect, and manage cyber threats and attacks.
                    My interests include playing video games, which actually led to me being part of the USCA E-Sports team for Overwatch,
                    but I also enjoy travelling with my wife and taking care of animals. I have a cat named "Ozzy Oscar Ozwald Bartholomew Lambert III".
